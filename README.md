# ðŸ’° Finance Tracker & Investment Simulator

The **Finance Tracker & Investment Simulator** is a full-stack educational web app designed for **students and young adults** to learn budgeting, saving, and investing â€” all in one place.  
It combines **a finance tracker** (for managing daily expenses and savings) with **a virtual investment simulator**, where users can practise making investments without any real-world risk.

## Project Motivation

When I started university, I realised how hard it was to manage money effectively. Most budgeting apps were either **too complex**, **not engaging**, or required **paid subscriptions**.  

So I decided to build **my own finance app** â€” one thatâ€™s intuitive, visually engaging, and educational.

The idea grew into a system that doesnâ€™t just track expenses but also helps users **learn how investments work**, safely and realistically.

Users can save, spend, and simulate buying stocks, tracking their growth using **live market prices** pulled via API â€” without risking real money.

## Core Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

### Full-Stack Architecture
* **Backend:** Java + Spring Boot REST API
* **Frontend:** React.js with modern hooks (useEffect, useCallback, useMemo)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Authentication:** JWT-based secure login system with role-based access

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Built modular classes and services (e.g., `InvestmentService`, `UserService`, `TransactionService`)
* Applied encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction for code scalability and clarity
* Used polymorphism in handling different transaction types (income, expense, investment)

### Data Structures & Algorithms
* Used data structures like `ArrayLists`, `HashMaps`, and `LinkedHashSets` to manage transactions and portfolio data efficiently
* Implemented algorithms for **balance calculation**, **growth projection**, and **investment performance visualization**
* Focused on **time-efficient data retrieval** for real-time portfolio updates

### Database Schema (EDR Diagram)

#### Database Login Console
*The console used to access the database during development.*

### API Integration
* Frontend communicates securely with the backend using **Axios** and **JWT Bearer Tokens**
* Implemented **RESTful endpoints** for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Integrated **third-party financial data APIs** to fetch live stock prices dynamically

### Frontend Engineering
* Developed a responsive React dashboard with reusable components
* Integrated **data visualization** libraries for displaying portfolio growth, expense trends, and savings distribution
* Focused on clean UI and user-centered interaction flow
* Learned how to work with Bezier curves (sort of)

### Authentication & Security
* **JWT token validation** using custom Spring Security filters (`JwtAuthFilter`)
* Stateless session management and secure password hashing (**BCrypt**)
* CORS configuration for safe frontendâ€“backend communication

### Backend Engineering Principles
* **Layered architecture** (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository)
* Exception handling with global error responses
* Clean separation of business logic and persistence layers

## In Progress / Coming Soon

* ðŸ”¹ **Investment Logic Enhancements** â€“ buying/selling simulation, profit/loss tracking, and portfolio history
* ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Data Visualization** â€“ interactive charts for investment growth over time
* ðŸ”¹ **Improved Transaction Categorization** â€“ machine-learning-based expense grouping (experimental idea)
* ðŸ”¹ **UI/UX Refinements** â€“ Apple-style clean design and accessibility features
* ðŸ”¹ **Performance Optimization** â€“ caching, request batching, and pagination

## Future Goals

* Deploy full system using Docker + AWS
* Add support for multiple currencies and savings goals
* Integrate AI-driven financial insights (budget tips and investment risk analysis)

## Setup & Run

> **Note:** The app currently requires authentication and backend setup, so cloning it for use wonâ€™t work fully unless connected to your local backend with valid JWT setup. However, feel free to explore the codebase â€” it demonstrates secure backend integration, API design, and full-stack logic.

If youâ€™d still like to run it locally for testing:

### Backend
```bash
# Backend
cd finance-tracker
mvn spring-boot:run

### Backend
```bash
cd finance-tracker
./mvnw spring-boot:run
